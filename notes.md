#  My DS Notes
This is a repository for my notes
*this should not crash the code or my site
*I've learned that if you are lost type pwd
*then type ls
*if you don't want to be lost hit CD~
*if you wish to backtrack cd ..
*if you want to cut a corner in pushing use the command add -(I gotta look this one up)
*I've learned that messages in the terminal do not  have to cryptic or scary
*they just have to be read slowly
